In the world of Software development, ensuring that applications are built, tested, and deployed rapidly and reliably is crucial. As businesses strive to stay competitive and meet the evolving needs of users, the traditional methods of manual software development and deployment are no longer sufficient. This is where Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines come into play. 
CI/CD pipelines automate the entire process of software delivery, from code integration to deployment, enabling development teams to iteratively build, test, and deploy applications with speed and precision. By breaking down the development lifecycle into smaller, manageable increments, CI/CD pipelines facilitate frequent and incremental updates, ensuring that new features and bug fixes reach users in a timely manner. In this project report, we explore the creation of an Ultimate CI/CD pipeline using popular DevOps tools.
